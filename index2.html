      <h1>WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL PAGE OF HEBELZEUA</h1>
      <p>
        Hello everyone, I have been interested in making Youtube videos since I was 12 and it was truly a dream come true once I got started. I quickly gained recognition and got good feedback from my viewers saying they actually enjoyed my humour and content so that motivated me into making more videos. Doing this is a hobby for me and my team that I gathered from different countries. We found each other online due to having the same interests. They did not want any payment and were willing to do it for gaining the experience as editing is their hobby. It cost me nothing to start up my own channel and you could do the same too.

        Well I normally try to find something I really enjoy and love and something that the people would enjoy watching too, I mostly make my videos and style of videos of how I like them to be. I try making funny videos so people would laugh if they arent in a good mood. I literally say the weirdest stuff out of the blue.
      </p>
      <p class="ff-flex-item">
        I like watching short videos instead of long videos because they get too boring in between and I would not be able to enjoy the video, so what I do is try making short videos to satisfy the viewers as well as me especially as a new and small youtuber making long content is going to be hard because no one would be interested in watching

        <h3>PS4</h3>
        <p>
          If you are using your PS4 and want to stream or record it, don’t worry, it is actually really easy. All you will need is a good pair of headphones and an editing software. This will help you to properly check your audio and be able to modify and cut your videos into sections that you will be needing. You may also be able to add different effects of your choice and check how smoothly the video flows. I personally use DaVinci as it is free is really good in my opinion.  It is one of the best free editing software you can record through PS4 and are able to save it by first pressing the option button and then press save. Now you will be able to render the video later onto your laptop whenever you want. However, as easy as it is you can always use any software that you are comfortable with.
